\chapter{Set Theory} \label{ch3}

For now we pause to introduce the concepts and notation of set theory, as they will be used increasingly heavily in
later chapters.

While set theory is not the main focus of this text, almost every other branch of mathematics relies on set theory as part of its foundation, so it is important to get at least some grounding in set theory before doing other advanced areas of mathematics.

In this chapter we present the more elementary aspects of \emph{axiomatic} set theory, leaving more advanced topics such as a discussion of infinite sets and the axiom of choice to
\CH{8}.

為何到第八章才講那些進階的東西?\ 因為直到第八章之前的定理都不用依靠那些東西。
